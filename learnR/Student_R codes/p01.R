# generate 1000 random numbers between 0 and 100:
x <- rnorm(1000, mean = 100, sd = 2)

# to illustrate previous, we show the histogram:
hist(x, col = "khaki3")

# This part code is after the histogram. It could be 
# following the previous part and form a unit that is
# interupted by the outpuf of the 'hist(..)'-command.
# In rare cases the plot will be on the this page
# alone and this code that follows appears on the 
# previous page.

# First, generate some data:
x <- c(1,2,3)

# Then calculate the mean:

# PLEASE READ: Making a new issue for _Tidy Models with R_


Thanks for giving us feedback on the book. Please follow these guidelines:

Please state the version of the book by referencing the **version** and **date** on the book's first page (under the title and authors). 


## Comments or questions on the content

Please tell us where exactly the issue is (e.g. chapter, section, figure number, etc.) and, whenever possible, copy/paste the text in question using `>` in the issue. 
For example: 

>  In 0.0.1.9000 (2020-03-05), capitalization in article/book names are inconsistent. Also, sometimes initials are used for names, sometimes not: 

> Agresti, Alan. 2012. Categorical Data Analysis. Wiley-Interscience.
> Altman, D. 1991. “Categorising Continuous Variables.” British Journal of Cancer, no. 5:975.

## Potential Bugs

Since the repo and data are publicly available, it should be entirely possible to create a minimal reprex (reproducible example).

The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it: please help me help you!

If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading "[What is a reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex#what-is-a-reprex)", and follow the advice further down that page.
